# Data Ingest Workshop: 
A guided journey in processing authoritative data into VIVO  
*presented at VIVO Conference 2013*

Welcome to the Data Ingest Workshop!  At the completion of this workshop, you'll have had hands on experience processing tabular relational data into VIVO using the UI and then transforming that initial process into an automated process.  You should be able to identify the various methods used to get data into VIVO and be ready to explore some of them on your own.

The course will be broken into four parts with a 10 minute break
